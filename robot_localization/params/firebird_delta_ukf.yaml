# The choice of parameters has been explained (along with suggested changes for a diffrent use case)
# Tutorial: http://docs.ros.org/api/robot_localization/html/configuring_robot_localization.html

# A timing guide for robot_localization:
# By default, robot_localization runs the prediction step upto a measurement, then a correction step, then a prediction
# step and so on upto the last measurement. If the last measurement hasn't timed out yet, then it publishes the 
# estimate upto that correction step (with the measurement's timestamp). Otherwise, it carries out a prediction upto 
# the current time and publishes that (with the current timestemp). This can cause 2 problems: 
# 1. Increasing the sensor timeout beyond 1/frequency can cause robot_localization to publish duplicate odometry  
#   messages (with the SAME TIMESTAMP too), if the sensor frequncy drops below the frequency of robot_localization. 
#   This can cause problems with certain nodes (eg: cartographer).
# 2. If we run robot_localization at a frequency higher than the sensors, then it will have to carry out a 
#   prediction-only cycle between prediction-correction cycles. This means that if the sensors are publishing slightly 
#   delayed messages, then robot_localization will publish some real-time messages between delayed messages. This can 
#   lead to erratic (even reversing) timestamps, which can cause problems with certain nodes (eg: cartographer).
# If we set predict_to_current_time to true, then robot_localization will always predict upto the current time, even 
# after the last correction step (even if the sensor has not timed out). This means that all the outputs will be 
# predicted ones (the control input and covariance tuning become crucial now), but the above problems will be solved.

# Raw wheel odometry is being used. Note that in this case, the twist covariance is bounded but the pose covariance
# grows with time. So, x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw are all ignored. (Also, they are basically duplicate measurements)
# The firebird delta is a non-holonomic ground robot but the model used by robot_localization is an omnidirectional 3D
# model. Thus, vy and vz will 'always' be zero and the same must be known by the ukf algorithm to predict states 
# accurately. On the other hand, vx will be usually non-zero and the value given by odometry.twist will be close to the
# actual value, wherever the ground is flat. So, vx, vy, vz are all used.
# vroll, vpitch may be non-zero wherever the ground surface is curved but there is no way to calculate those from the 
# wheel odometry (odometry.twist gives 0). vyaw will be usually non-zero and the value given by odometry.twist will be 
# close to the actual value, wherever the ground is flat. So, vroll, vpitch are ignored and vyaw is used.
# Note that twist (vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw) is always specified in the robot frame and not the odom frame.

# A Pixhawk IMU is being used. Magnetometer yaw is pretty accurate outdoors (std_dev ~ 3 deg) but not indoor. The

# accelerometer does provide some additional information but we already have accurate velocities, so the higher order

# The better the omnidirectional motion model matches the non-holonomic ground robot's motion in a particular aspect
# the smaller the corresponding covariance. If a given variable is slow to converge, one approach is to increase the
# process_noise_covariance diagonal value for the variable in question.
# The rationale behind tuning this particular process noise covariance matrix is as follows:
# Whenever our predictions are off by (standard deviation) a value v in t seconds, the covariance should grow to v^2 
# in t seconds. The corresponding value in the matrix should be v^2/t (process covariance defined for unit time step).
# ax, ay, az: ax can change from 0 to ~0.5 m/s^2 within 0.1s. The control input is converted to acceleration and so 
# the predicted acceleration (same as prior acceleration) can be off by 0.25 m/s^2 in 0.05s (as frequency = 20Hz). ay 
# and az are not considered anywhere, so left unchanged.
# vr, vp, vy: Since ar, ap are not computed, vr and vp are predicted to be same as before. We assume that the robot 
# may have to roll or pitch by 0.25 radian within a period of 0.5s (due to ditches and ramps). So our prediction can 
# be off by 0.5 rad/s within the time it is calculated from the difference of 2 IMU readings (0.2s). vy can be off by 
# 2 rad/s^2 * 0.05s before control is used for prediction i.e., 0.1 rad/s in 0.05s.
# vx, vy, vz: vx can be off by 0.7 m/s^2 * 0.05s before control is used for prediction i.e., 0.035 m/s in 0.05s. vy 
# and vz are always exactly zero. Once they converge to zero, we do not want them to change easily, so we set very low 
# values corresponding to these.
# r, p, y: vr and vp are used in predicting r and p but they are being calculated from r and p too. Thus, the 
# prediction from that will be too late and the r and p predictions will stay the same during that interval. By the 
# time an IMU reading arrives, our estimate (constant) will be off by 0.5 rad/s * 0.1s i.e., 0.05 rad in 0.1s. Based 
# on the max angular speed and acceleration, the predicted y will be off by 0.1 rad/s * 0.1s due to the speed error 
# and (1/2) * 2 rad/s^2 * (0.1s)^2 due to the acceleration of the robot i.e., 0.02 rad in 0.1s.
# x, y, z: These are not corrected, only predicted. So we can calculate the covariance from the observed ~5m drift in 
# each direction after running the bot for ~500s.

# Raw wheel odometry is being used. Note that in this case, the twist covariance is bounded but the pose covariance
# grows with time. So, x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw are all ignored. (Also, they are basically duplicate measurements)
# The firebird delta is a non-holonomic ground robot but the model used by robot_localization is an omnidirectional
# 3D model. Thus, vy and vz will 'always' be zero and the same must be known by the ukf algorithm to predict states 
# accurately. On the other hand, vx will be usually non-zero and the value given by odometry.twist will be close to
# the actual value, wherever the ground is flat. So, vx, vy, vz are all used.
# vroll, vpitch may be non-zero wherever the ground surface is curved but there is no way to calculate those from 
# the wheel odometry (odometry.twist gives 0). vyaw will be usually non-zero and the value given by odometry.twist 
# will be close to the actual value, wherever the ground is flat. So, vroll, vpitch are ignored and vyaw is used.
# Note that twist (vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw) is always specified in the robot frame and not the odom frame.

# A Pixhawk IMU is being used. Magnetometer yaw is pretty accurate outdoors (std_dev ~ 3 deg) but not indoor.
# The gyroscope and accelerometer work well indoors but produce some outliers outdoors.
# The Pixhawk is already generating a sensor-fused orientation using the magnetometer, the gyroscope and the
# accelerometer readings. So, roll, pitch, yaw are used and vroll, vpitch, vyaw are ignored (duplicate data).
# The accelerometer does provide some additional information but we already have accurate velocities, so the
# higher order derivatives (ax, ay, az) can be safely ignored. (robot_localization will assume 0 acceleration
# when predicting states without any new measurements.)
